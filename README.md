- 👋 Hi, I’m @tboneofredveeyay. My name is Terry, or TBone. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Information Technology and computer science, specifically cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software design through Python in my local community college. I am in my first semester of my AAS Cybersecurity degree. My classes are online, and I am taking those "core" classes that are very much dreaded.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning as much code to advance my stance with AI in the coming years. 
- 📫 How to reach me : I can be reached via email. My personal is lucky07tbone@gmail.com or my school email which is tws27788@email.vccs.edu
